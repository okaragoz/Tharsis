# Open access repository for Unraveling the Tectonic History of Tharsis Rise on Mars

## Description
This repository contains the open-source data and resources utilized in our research paper "Unraveling the tectonic history of the Tharsis rise on Mars: plume migration and critical taper dome". The aim of this repository is to foster transparency and reproducibility of the study, as well as to serve as a resource for researchers interested in the geological history of Mars.

## Content
The repository includes the following data:

- ALL.xls: A list of the geographic locations of all mapped wrinkle ridges segments used in the study.
- Fit: Folder containing all input files necessary for running the concentric deviation computation on MATLAB.
- Ridges: GIS-ready polyline files of mapped wrinkle ridge segments in this study.
These data were utilized to derive critical insights into the tectonic history of the Tharsis rise on Mars.

## Usage
To use this data:

Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
Extract the data files.
The ALL.xls can be read and manipulated using MATLAB.
The files in the "Fit" folder is a deviation_fitting.m script file for the concentric deviation computation. To reproduce our results, you should run your own computation using these files.
