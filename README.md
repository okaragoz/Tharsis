# Open access repository for Unraveling the Tectonic History of Tharsis Rise on Mars

Unraveling the Tectonic History of Tharsis Rise on Mars
Description
This repository contains the open-source data and resources utilized in our research paper "Unraveling the tectonic history of the Tharsis rise on Mars: plume migration and critical taper dome". The aim of this repository is to foster transparency and reproducibility of the study, as well as to serve as a resource for researchers interested in the geological history of Mars.

Content
The repository includes the following data:

ALL.xls: A list of the geographic locations of all mapped wrinkle ridges segments used in the study.
Fit: Folder containing all input files necessary for running the concentric deviation computation on MATLAB.
These data were utilized to derive critical insights into the tectonic history of the Tharsis rise on Mars.
Ridges: GIS-ready polyline files of mapped wrinkle ridge segments in this study.

Usage
To use this data:

Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
Extract the data files.
The ALL.xls can be read and manipulated using MATLAB.
The files in the "Fit" folder is a deviation_fitting.m script file for the concentric deviation computation. To reproduce our results, you should run your own computation using these files.
Contributing
